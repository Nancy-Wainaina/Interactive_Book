 Their arch enemy, the "SPD" had discovered their hiding place. "Who turned it
off?" whined Collin. "Oh look, it's the so-called "SPD". Betty replied. "Yep, we
are the ones. You tinny rats don't deserve such lovely music and fun." revolted
Peyton, the leader of "SPD". Let's kick their butts out of here." Stella shouted.
"But wait, one more time.......” Alberto switches the player back on. The six
dances to the song for a couple of minutes before Deu knocks down a can of
baked beans on the player and it stops playing. They all pause for a second. Then
Alberto breaks the silence. “Uh……. where were you?", "Oh yeah, kicking their
butts out of here," Peyton answered.<br> <br>
"Let's get them," Stella said as she pounces on Betty and the fight begins. It
becomes a nasty battle between ABC and SPD. A punch flies through the air until
Peyton holds Alberto's fist and says, "Oh no, let me teach him" He tackles Alberto
to the ground and his wristwatch produces a toothbrush and he starts vigorously
brushing Alberto's teeth. Collins and Deu are in their own tangle, "let go of me."
screamed little Deu. While the two young ones are in a serious fight, Collin's
choo-train collectible falls out of his pocket and Deu accidentally steps on it and
breaks it. <br> <br>The two pause for a minute and Collins bursts out into a loud cry. The
rest stop fighting while Peyton approaches Collins, feeling very sympathetic for
him. "What did you do to the little guy? There, there don't cry." Peyton scolds
Deu and continues patting Collin on the back. Collin blows his nose with his hand
and wipes it on his clothes. Peyton looks perplexed for a moment, slightly
disgusted, and then offers him a handkerchief and says, "You don't do it that way
Cover the top of your nose with the tissue, wipe your nose, dump the tissue, and
wash your hands with water and soap." Collins was touched and very happy. He
covers his nose, wipes it, dumps the tissue, and washes his hands with soap
and water. Betty felt her blood boil and Alberto was fuming. Stella cleared 
her throat, "uhm, uhm…. I thought we were here to kick batt, not wipe it." she
says. Deu leaps onto Alberto and the fight resumes.<br> <br>
In the middle of the ongoing fight, Betty sees a toothbrush in Stella's pocket
and then calls her friends, “Alberto, Collins, hurry……" then they took off,
Collins, the little guy said, "Thanks…… for………, the big save again, they
wanted to cut off my pretty hair." "I think we need to stay home tonight because
the SPD may get us on the street and clean us. Brrrrr…..” Betty said.
“Hahahahaha……!!! I see you fellas, are fearing the SPD now. Hmm…….. I will
destroy those nosy SPD kids before they get close to us. Ugh……. those guys
won't ever want to see us succeed." Betty replied as they ride their floating
scooters back to their lair.
