            <h3>The Battle</h3>
            <p>Maleficent, sensing Phillip's approach, transformed into a fearsome dragon to stop him. A fierce battle ensued. With the fairies' magic aiding him, Phillip fought valiantly. Flames roared and the ground shook, but he pressed on, determined to save Aurora.
        
                With one final, powerful strike, Phillip plunged his sword into the dragon's heart. Maleficent let out a terrible cry before collapsing and dissolving into ashes.
