    <h1>Little Miss rat</h1>
    <p>"Little Miss Rat" chronicles the journey of Luna, a curious rat born into a bustling colony in a forgotten attic. Despite warnings from her family about the dangers of the outside world, Luna's thirst for adventure and love for storytelling drive her to explore beyond the safety of her home. Along the way, Luna faces rejection, hunger, and doubt, but she also encounters kindness, inspiration, and friendship. With determination and the support of a kind bookseller named Mrs. Maple, Luna fulfills her dream of becoming a writer, sharing her tales of magic and wonder with the world. Through Luna's courageous pursuit of her dreams, the story celebrates the power of imagination, resilience, and the transformative journey of self-discovery.
