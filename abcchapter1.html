 <h1 id="chapterOne">Chapter One</h1> 
 
<p> In the bustling streets of Thomio city, deep in the dark night, a battle arises, that
    is not by fists or brawn, but by soap and water. "Uh …… do you guys think this
    is a good idea?” whined Collin
     “Shut up you moron. I am trying to cheer you up with of a cool spy movie.
    Duuuuhn it is gonna be like one of those cool action movies on TV. Replied Betty.
    “We are gonna kick those kids who are claiming to be hygienic, Ugh …. "I detest
    that word" Betty roared.
     As the two argued, Alberto continued with his attempt to break a fire
    hydrant that stood along the pavement.<br><br> "Good work buddy. Now let us break into
    that towel shop and you know what is next. Suddenly, the fire hydrant exploded
    and water gushed fourth and flooded the area. This drew the attention of everyone
    on the block. In panic, the trio hurriedly vacated the scene as they held an extreme
    hatred for water. They continued further into the alley and hid inside the trash
    bin, in an attempt to avoid the angry mob that was trailing them. Still breathing
    heavily, Betty whispered, "The place is quiet, guess we lost them,"
    Betty smacks Alberto's back, "Why'd you do that? you know I cannot stand a
    shower.” “But I was just doing my job.<br><br> The nut was too tight and you should try
    it next time, miss bossy." replied Alberto. "How dare you call me that? I'm your
    leader and you should respect me." Betty said angrily. The two continue arguing
    while Collin struggle to find something in the bin. Then beaming with a smile,
    holds out something, "Look what I found, a cassette tape." Betty and Alberto
    rolled their eyes," Stop goofing around, we are here for some serious destructive
    business." Betty said. Within a few seconds, Collin held the cassette player and
    a song was playing (Soweto by Victory). They got taken up by the dancing and
    fun which was shortly interrupted by a loud thud and silencing of the speakers. </p>
